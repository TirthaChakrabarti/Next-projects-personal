Next project initially has 4 folders and 10 files [9 for me: tailwind.config.ts is absent]
(after starting with 'npm run dev')

1) package.json: 
    It has all dependencies and scripts 

- dev : For development mode 
- build : For production builds
- start : For running the production server 
- lint : For setting up Next's built-in Eslint configuration 

2,3,4,5) Configuration files for Next, Typescript, TailwindCSS and Eslint 

6) package-lock.json:
    Ensures consistent installation of dependencies 

7) gitignore:
    For version control 

8) README.md:
    Contains few instructions related to running, building and deploying the application
