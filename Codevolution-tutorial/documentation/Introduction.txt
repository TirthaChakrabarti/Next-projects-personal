Next.js: 
A React framework for building full-stack web application

*Limitation of React:

-React is a library for building user interfaces (View layer)
-Using React, it is not feasible to create a fully-featured appplication ready for production
React
-We need more features like Routing, Data fetching and more 

*Next.js uses React for building user interfaces and also provides additional features that enable us to build production ready applications. No additional packages needed.

Features include:
    - Routing
    - Optimized rendering
    - Data fetching 
    - Bundling 
    - Compiling
      etc.

*Next.js being a framework has opinions and conventions

-----------------

Next.js simplifies the process of building production-ready web applications:

- Routing: 
    React needs installing and configuring 3rd party routing packages everytime it needs to create the route
    Next.js simplifies this with files-based routing 
    [Create files and routes are automatically generated]

- API routes:
    Next.js is a full-stack framework: 
    Can build frontend React components and backend APIs within same Next.js application 
    Ensures seemless integration between frontend and backend code

- Rendering:
    Both Server-side and Client-side rendering is possible
    Leads to improves performance and better Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

- Data fetching:
    Streamlined data fetching through built-in async-await support in React component 
    Makes data fetching straightforward and efficient

- Styling:
    Flexible with styling approaches 
    Supports CSS modules, TailwindCSS, CSS and JS solutions etc. 

- Optimization: 
    Provides out-of-the-box Optimization for images, fonts and scripts
    Thus enhances the application's core web vitals and overall user experience

- Dev and Prod build system 
    Optimized development and production-build system 
    We can focus on building codes instead of dealing with complex configurations

-----------------

**We need Node.js to run Next.js (Version 18.18 or later)
