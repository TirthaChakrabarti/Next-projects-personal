The Metadata API in Next.js is a powerful feature that lets us define metadata for each page.
Metadata ensures our content looks great when it's shared or indexed by search engines.

Two ways to handle metadata in layout.tsx or page.tsx files:

- Export s static metadata object
- Export a dynamic generateMetadata function

**Configuring Routing Metadata:

Matadata rules:
--------------

- Both layout.tsx and page.tsx export metadata. Layout metadata applies to all its pages, while page metadata is specific to that page

- Metadata follows a top-down order, starting from the root level

- When metadata exists in multiple places along a route, they merge together, with page metadata overriding layout metadata for matching properties
[Deeper component gets priority]

Example:
In this project, localhost:3000 shows metadata as in Rooy layout 
But, for localhost:3000/about page, title is replaced with its own metadata title (description is intact and about page doesn't have description metadata)


Dynamic Metadata:
-----------------

It comes in handy when the metadata depends on dynamic information like current route parameters, external data or metadata defined in parant segment

- Both layout.tsx and page.tsx can generate it by exporting a generateMetadata 

Example: 
We defined one in [productId]'s page.tsx

**We cannot use a static Metadata object and dynamic generateMetadata function in the same Route segment 
It is either this or that.
