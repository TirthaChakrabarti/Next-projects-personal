React Server Component (RSC): 

A new architecture introduced by React team and quickly adopted by Next.js 

It is a new approach to creating React components by dividing into two distinc types:
    - Server components
    - Client components 

Server components:

- By default, Next.js treats all components as Server components
- These components can perform server-side tasks like reading files or fetching data directly from a Database
- The trade-off is that they can't use React hooks or handle user interactions 

Client components: 

- To create a Client component, add "use client" directive at the top of component file

- Client components cannot perform server-side tasks like reading files 
- They can use hooks and handle user interactions
- They are the traditional React components we're familier with from previous versions of React 

React Server Components and Routing:

We work with server components that wait for certain operations to complete before rendering content
We use client components to take advantage of hooks from the routing module
