Non-existing routes are automatically handles by Next.js (a 404: Not Found page)
We don't need to manually write any code to handle this error

*Although we can have customized page for this [not-found.tsx in this project]

We can also trigger it programatically using not-found function
Example: not-found used in product review in this project 

**NotFound() function dosn't take any parameter
To make the messaging dynamic for it (depending on route parameter), we have to use usePathName hook from Next.js
[example: not-found.tsx in [reviewId] folder]
