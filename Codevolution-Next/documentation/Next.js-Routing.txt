Next.js has a file-system based routing system:
    URLs we access in our browser are determined by how we organize our files and folders in our code

Routing conventions:

1. All routes must live inside the App folder
2. Route files must be names page.js/page.tsx
3. Each folder represents a segment of the URL path 

When these conventions are followed, the file automatically becomes available as a route 

Example: 
page.tsx file inside App folder automatically maps to our site's root URL 

Creating Routes:

1) app/page.tsx - localhost:3000/
2) app > about/page.tsx - localhost:3000/about 
3) app > profile/page.tsx - locanhost:3000/profile 

Non-existing routes are automatically handles by Next.js (a 404: Not Found page)
We don't need to manually write any code to handle this error

** This way Next.js file-based routing does the heavylifting.
** We don't need to install and configure Router unlike React.js 
[This is Next's 'Convention over Configuration' philosophy when it comes to Routing]

// Nested Routes 

app > blog > - first > page.tsx 
             - second > page.tsx 

// Dynamic Routes 

app > products > [productId] > page.tsx
