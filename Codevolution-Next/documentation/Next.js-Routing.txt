Next.js has a file-system based routing system:
    URLs we access in our browser are determined by how we organize our files and folders in our code

Routing conventions:

1. All routes must live inside the App folder
2. Route files must be names page.js/page.tsx
3. Each folder represents a segment of the URL path 

When these conventions are followed, the file automatically becomes available as a route 

Example: page.tsx file inside App folder altomatically maps to our site's root URL
