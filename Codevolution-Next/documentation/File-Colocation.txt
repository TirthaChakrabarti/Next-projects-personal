// File Colocation 
-------------------

We can savely co-locate project files inside Route segments in the App directory without worrying about them accidentally becoming routes themselves

Example: dashboard folder and page.tsx file 

[We can have files outside of the App folder as well]

// Private folders 
-------------------

This is for internal stuff. 
This folder and all its sub-folders are excluded from Routing.
Add an underscore at the start of folder name to create a private folder 
This is where we may keep utility functions like format-date.ts 

Private folder are super useful for:

-Keeping UI logic separate from Routing logic 
-Having a consistent way to organize internal files in the project 
-Making it easier to group related files in our code editor
-Avoiding potential naming conflicts with future Next.js file naming conventions

[To have an underscore in URL, we can use "%5F" instead. That's URL-encoded version of an underscore]
