Next project initially has 4 folders and 10 files [9 for me: tailwind.config.ts is absent]
(after starting with 'npm run dev')

-------------------

Files: 

1) package.json: 
    It has all dependencies and scripts 

- dev : For development mode 
- build : For production builds
- start : For running the production server 
- lint : For setting up Next's built-in Eslint configuration 

2,3,4,5) Configuration files for Next, Typescript, TailwindCSS and Eslint 

6) package-lock.json: 
    Ensures consistent installation of dependencies 

7) gitignore: 
    For version control 

8) README.md: 
    Contains few instructions related to running, building and deploying the application 

9) next-env.d.ts: 
    For Typescript declarations for Next.js 

-----------------

Folders: 

1) .next: 
    Gets created when dev/build is run. Next app is served from here
    [This is gitignored so not much to worry about it during development]

2) node_modules:
    Home of all our installed dependencies 
    Gets created by 'npm install' or when we run the dev script which handles the installations automatically in needed
    [This is also gitignored]

3) public: 
    All static assets like images and svgs go here 

4) Source:
    It has the 'app' folder [App router]
    It has 4 files:

    - favicon : Browser tab icon 
    - global.css : Application-wide styles
    - layout.tsx : Shared UI elements across pages 
    - page.tsx : 
            creates what we see at localhost:3000
            Home component is defined here 
            Slots into layout.tsx as children props

--------------------------------

Control flow:

npm run dev > 
starts from package.json >
layout.tsx >
renders RootLayout component >
looks for page.tsx at 'app' folder (for localhost:3000) >
gets Home component at page.tsx >
renders it inside RootLayout
