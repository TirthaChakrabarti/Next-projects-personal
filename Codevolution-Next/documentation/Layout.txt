Pages are route-specific UI components
A Layout is UI that is shared between multiple pages  in your app 

*Default export a React component from a layout.js and layout.tsx file 
*That component takes a children prop, which Next.js will populate with your page content

- layout.tsx in App folder is 'Root layout'. 
It is not optional. It's so mandatory that Next.js automatically re-creates it even if deleted.

When we visit root URL (localhost:3000), root layout component in layout.tsx in App folder gets rendered. Its children prop gets replaced with the component defined in page.tsx in App folder. Similarly, if we visit any other route, its own page.tsx replaces the children prop.


Nested Layout : 
--------------

These are layouts defined in sub-folders of App folder
